# ggcharts 0.2.1.9000

- The default color of `theme_nightblue()` has been changed from #FF7AFD to
  #D81E5B

- The background color of `theme_ggcharts()` has been changed from #F4F7FC to
  #C7C7C7. In addition, the foreground color has been changed from #002451 to
  #080708.

# ggcharts 0.2.1

- The themes only set the `plot.title.position` element if a version of
  `{ggplot2}` >= 3.3.0 is installed. This fixes #75.

# ggcharts 0.2.0

- Two new vignettes: `customize` (#54) and `themes` (#69)

- Two additional datasets: `popeurope` and `popch` (#60)

- The default theme has been tweaked and is now exported as `theme_ggcharts()`

- Additionally, three other new themes have been created: `theme_ng()`,
  `theme_nightblue()` and `theme_hermit()`

- The default `ggcharts` theme can be changed using `ggcharts_set_theme()`

- `highlight_spec()` has been introduced to enable full customization when
  highlighting

- The `limit` argument of `bar_chart()`, `lollipop_chart()` and
  `dumbbell_chart()` has been deprecated in favor of `top_n` (#62)

- `lollipop_chart()` and `bar_chart()` display the number of cases in each
  distinct value of `x` if the `y` argument is missing (#48)

- `lollipop_chart()` and `bar_chart()` gained an `other` argument. If a
  threshold is set and `other = TRUE` all categories with values less than the
  threshold are aggregated and displayed at the bottom of the chart (#67)

- Error messages are thrown using `rlang::abort()` rather than `stop()` (#32)

- A legend used to pop up when the theme of a chart with highlights was changed.
  This has been fixed in #41
